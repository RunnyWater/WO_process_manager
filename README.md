<h1>WO_process_manager</h1>
<p>Makes figures from excel sheets with WO data sets.</p>
<p>You can use the program for your own good if you have the same Excel sheet structure as it has in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b0plqR5RodygHOkzW2pEYDcle3SSPAS-0mcqIkvEljg/edit?usp=sharing">mine</a>.</p>
<p>Also the example of what and how it has to look like you can find on this image below</p>
<p><b>! IMPORTANT ! Number of sets isn't limited to 4, only the layout and format of numbers matter!</b></p>
